# What a software engineer should know?

## Math

Why would you want to know basic math? Well, doesn't matter what you think, math is undercover of everything computer related. It will help you take all sorts of computer processes from the realm of magic to relatively understandable concepts. It's not something very crucial to become a developer, some of math concepts are used intuitively, like `boolean algebra` and some `logic`, and I'd even recommend skipping this part if you're completely new to programming.
